    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, we implemented a mass-spring system to simulate cloth. We added forces from the springs
      and used Verlet integration to calculate the new mass positions from one timestep to the next. The system was
      extended to handle collisions with spheres and planes as well as self-collisions to fix clipping. Finally, we
    implemented different types of vertex and fragment shaders to get a variety of different visuals on our cloth.</p>

  <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
  </a>
    <blockquote><b>
      Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. 
      To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again. 
      You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.
      <br />
      <small>
      Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>? 
      A high <code>ks</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      With a low ks value, the cloth is a lot more flexible and stretchy as it falls. This happens because with a small
      spring constant, the springs exert a smaller force on the point masses, so the point masses can move more freely
      from one another.

      <br>

      With a high ks value, the cloth is more stiff and rigid as it falls. This is because with a large spring constant,
      the springs exert a larger force on the point masses, so the point masses' movement is more restricted to one
      another. As a result, the cloth wants to keep a stable, flat state.
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>density</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      With a low density, the cloth doesn't fold as much in the rest state. This is due to the acceleration forces being
      weaker on the point masses, so the spring forces exert a greater force than the gravitational ones. This results
      in the cloth being in its flat state.

      <br>

      With a higher density, the cloth folds a lot more in the rest state. This happens because with a higher density,
      the acceleration acting between the point masses is less because the mass is increased. With a smaller acceleration
      acting between the point masses, the cloth is allowed to bend more because the adjacent point masses aren't pulling
      on each as much (smaller acceleration).
    </p>
    
    
    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      With higher dampening, the simulation is slower and less noisy (when the cloth falls to its resting state,
      it doesn't bounce around much). This happens because if the dampening is higher, then the displacement updates
      are much smaller.
      <br>
      With lower dampening, the simulation is much faster and more noisy i.e. when the cloth swings back when it
      falls down initially. Tis occurs because if the dampening is lower, then the displacement updates are larger.
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
      For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the default parameters 
      and show us some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur.

      <p>
        KS: As seen in the images, a low ks makes the cloth more flexible, which is shown by the folds as
        it falls. With a high ks, the cloth is more stiff, which is shown by the minimal folding as it falls.
        The explanation for this can be seen above.

        <br>
        <br>

        Density: In all the images where density is varied, the cloth is in its resting state. With a low density,
        there is minimal folding. With a high density, the cloth has more folds in it.
        The explanation for this can be seen above.

        <br>
        <br>

        Damping: In the images where dampening is varied, the images were all taken roughly around the same time
        since starting the simulation. With the higher dampening, the cloth has only just started falling. In
        the lower dampening image, the cloth swung around.
        The explanation for this can be seen above.

      <small>Describe the differences in the results.</small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      With a lower <code>k_s</code> of 500, we have smaller spring forces acting upon the point masses.
      Thus, the masses can move more freely and we see that the cloth looks "droopier" while resting over
      the sphere. With a higher <code>k_s</code> of 50,000, we have much greater spring forces, so the masses
      cannot move as freely. Thus, the cloth looks much "stiffer" and also has less folds (since it is also
      stiffer in the horizontal direction).

    <p>
      With a lower density, there are greater spring forces acting upon the point masses. Thus,
      they cannot move as freely so there are less folds as the cloth falls. Once it hits the plane,
      we can see that there are only a few folds in the cloth. With a higher density, there are smaller
      spring forces acting upon the point masses. Thus, they can move more freely and crumple more as the
      cloth falls. Once it hits the plane, it is much more crumpled, and we see a lot of folds in the cloth.

      With a lower ks, there are weaker forces between the point masses, so this allows the point
      masses to move more freely in relation to one another. This is demonstrated with more folds for
      the lower ks. Conversely, a large ks results in less folds because the point masses are more restricted
      to one another.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is a small program that runs on the GPU (which can save us CPU time) for a specific step of the rasterization pipeline.
      The vertex shader deals with vertex geometries and feeds its output to the fragment shader. The fragment shader then uses these inputs to
      calculate a final color for the fragment.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model is a combination of an ambient light component, a specular reflection component, and a diffuse light component. The
      specular reflection component is especially important as it adds nice specular highlights to our material. Ambient shading helps add a constant
      color to our material and fill in shadows. Finally, diffuse lighting adds an overall matte appearance to our material.

    <p>
      In bump mapping, we are changing the normal vectors in the fragment shader so that we get the illusion
      of bumps. We see this in the images above, where the sphere and cloth now have bumps on their surface.
      In displacement mapping, we do this but also change the vertex positions themselves; thus, we see that
      the actual geometry of the sphere and cloth have been displaced with a zig-zag-like surface.
      <br>
      As we can see in the pictures above, there was no change in the bump mapping shader when we modified the
      sphere mesh's coarseness. This makes sense because in bump mapping, we are only modifying the normal vectors to
      give the illusion of detail. However, we do see a difference in displacement mapping. Specifically, we can see
      that the vertex displacements are more fine-grained at the higher resolution of 128x128 versus 16x16.
